# The LCBO Web Scraper

### Ryan, Why?

I first came to this idea sometime last summer, when my curiosity regarding webscraping was at its peak. I was webscraping various websites with success (YouTube, HLTV), however LCBO.com always came back and dished me a 403. As quickly as my enthusiasm had came for the project, it was gone.

Fast forward to a few days ago -- it's my 2B term, I'm living in residence, and my roommate and a friend are discussing cost effective alcohol. We can't settle on what it would be, but man, wouldn't we love to know, being the broke students we are.
